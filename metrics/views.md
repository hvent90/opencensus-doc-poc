Views are used to assemble all of the previous components in to an exportable dataset to be visualized on a backend.

 **Example**: By configuring your view with the client device tag, video size measure, and histogram aggregation, you will now be able to see histograms of all measurements taken \(which are video size measures that are filterable by client device\).
